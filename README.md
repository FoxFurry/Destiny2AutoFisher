# Destiny2AutoFisher
A simple Python script to automatically catch fish during Fishing Events in Destiny 2

## How to use

- Approach the pond during the fishing event
- Take a tea while the script handles everything

## What script can do?
- Automatically start fishing if the pond was approached
- Detect missed fish and restart fishing automatically

After a fishing event was detected, it emulates the keyboard presses to start the event, catch fish and restart in case of failure.

No, this script uses technologies that are safe for anti-cheat, however, using this script violates Destiny 2 EULA
